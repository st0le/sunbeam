<p>Sunbeam is a command-line launcher, inspired by <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf" rel="noopener noreferrer">fzf</a>, <a href="https://raycast.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">raycast</a> and <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum" rel="noopener noreferrer">gum</a>.</p>
<p>It allows you to build interactives UIs from simple scripts.</p>

<h2>Why sunbeam?</h2>
<p>I love TUIs, but I spent way to much time writing them.</p>
<p>I used a lot of application launchers, but all of them had some limitations.</p>
<p>Sunbeam try to address these limitations:</p>
<h3>Sunbeam runs on all platforms</h3>
<p>Sunbeam is distributed as a single binary, so you can run it on any platform. The sunbeam extension system is also designed to be cross-platform.</p>
<p><img src="./static/alacritty.png" alt="sunbeam running in alacritty"></p>
<h3>Sunbeam is language agnostic</h3>
<p>Sunbeam communicates with your scripts using JSON, so you can use any language you want.
The only requirement is that the script is executable and outputs a JSON object conforming to the Sunbeam JSON Schema on stdout.</p>
<p><img src="./static/vscode.png" alt="sunbeam running in vscode"></p>
<h3>Sunbeam is easy to extend</h3>
<p>Instead of reiventing the wheel, sunbeam relies on your familiarity with git and github to make it easy to create, update, publish and install extensions.</p>
<p>Creating a new extension is as easy as creating a new folder and adding a <code>sunbeam-extension</code> executable to it. Sunbeam supports installing extension from any git host, including github.</p>
<p>If you want your extension to be discoverable, you can also add a <code>sunbeam-extension</code> topic to your github repository.</p>
<p>Since sunbeam uses <code>git</code> under the hood, you can create private extensions by using private git repositories.</p>
<h3>Sunbeam supports custom clients</h3>
<p>Sunbeam comes with a built-in TUI to interact with your scripts, but you can also use any other client.</p>
<p>Currently the only alternative client is <a href="https://github.com/pomdtr/sunbeam-raycast" rel="noopener noreferrer">sunbeam-raycast</a>.</p>

<h2>Inspirations / Alternatives</h2>
<p>Sunbeam wouldn't exist without taking inspirations from incredible tools. Make sure to checkout:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://raycast.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">raycast</a>: Sunbeam shamelessly copy most of raycast UX. Even the project name is a reference to raycast.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf" rel="noopener noreferrer">fzf</a>: Sunbeam tries to take inspiration from fzf, but it's not a drop-in replacement. Sunbeam is designed to be used as a launcher, not as a fuzzy finder.</li>
<li><a href="https://slapdash.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">slapdash</a>: The sunbeam event loop was inspired by slapdash. Sadly, slapdash doesn't seem to be updated anymore.</li>
<li><a href="https://cli.github.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">gh</a>: The sunbeam extension system was inspired by gh, with some modifications to make it more flexible.</li>
</ul>
